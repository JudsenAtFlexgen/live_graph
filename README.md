# Proof of Concept
So the whole point I'm trying to demonstrate is that I could create a c interface to an existing cpp class (which will be site controller functionality) and then you can use the interfaces to _from golang_ 
create visualizations.

## Bonus meme
I have provided you a visualization using HTMX

## How to build
`./build.sh`
`./main`

### When in the vm you may need to perform port forwarding to see the UI on your browser
From windows `ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 hybridos@172.16.1.90`
You can then see the UI.
